I'm a finishing Ph.D student at the [University of Maryland, College Park Department of Astronomy](https://www.astro.umd.edu/), working in [Derek Richardson's](https://www.astro.umd.edu/~dcr/) research group. I study granular mechanics on low-gravity planetary surfaces (asteroids and Earth's Moon) using *N*-body and soft-sphere discrete element method (SSDEM) models. My primary research focus has been on the physical effects of the 2029 close approach of asteroid (99942) Apophis with Earth.

I grew up in Frederick, Maryland (United States). I received my B.S. in Astronomy and Physics at the University of Maryland, College Park in 2018. I earned my M.S. in Astronomy in 2020 at the University of Maryland, College Park, and will defend my Ph.D thesis at the University of Maryland in August of 2025. In addition to astronomy, I enjoy dancing (ballroom and swing), strength training, cooking (dairy-free!), video games, and tabletop roleplaying games.
