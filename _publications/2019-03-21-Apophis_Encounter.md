Abstract:

Near-Earth Asteroid 99942 Apophis presents a unique opportunity to study the dynamics, bulk properties, and
interior structure of a rubble-pile asteroid when it makes its close encounter with the Earth in 2029. In order to
better understand the potential outcomes of a tidal encounter between Earth and Apophis, and to support a
potential future mission to Apophis, we perform numerical simulations of the encounter. We represent Earth as a
single rigid sphere and the target body as a cohesionless, self-gravitating granular aggregate of identical spheres
in a hexagonal-close-packed conﬁguration subject only to gravitational and soft-sphere (elastic) contact forces.
We use a radar-derived shape model for the asteroid, along with current best estimates for the orbital solution of
Apophis to simulate the encounter trajectory, and perform a large parameter sweep over diﬀerent potential
encounter orientations and bulk densities for the body. We ﬁnd that the median change in the rotational period
for Apophis, sampled for a range of diﬀerent initial body and spin orientations, is −1.9 h (mean −0.1 ± 6.0 (1-
σ) hours) during the encounter. Additionally, we measure that the mean of the largest change in axis length
among the 3 primary body axes, also sampled over trials with diﬀerent initial body and spin orientations, is
0.132 ± 0.066 mm during the encounter, assuming a bulk Young's Modulus of 106 Pa. Such strains on the
timescale of peak stress during the encounter may be large enough to be detected by an in-situ seismometer.
