Abstract:

We numerically investigate tidally induced surface refreshing on Apophis during its close approach with Earth 
within a perigee distance of 5.96 Earth radii on 2029 April 13. We implement a tidal resurfacing model with two 
stages: dynamics modelling of the entire body to determine time-varying accelerations and surface slope profiles 
felt by each surface patch during the 6-h-long closest encounter, and discrete-element method modelling to track 
motions of surface grains in localized patches. The surface slope profiles and measured grain motions are combined 
to statistically extrapolate the ‘expected’ percentage of resurfaced area. Using the tidal resurfacing model, we 
present surface maps showing the total expected resurfacing on Apophis given three representative encounter 
orientations. Our simulation results indicate that tidal resurfacing, limited to certain localized regions, will 
likely occur half an hour before perigee and on the scale of 1 per cent of Apophis’s entire surface area. Our 
models indicate that the most likely locations to detect tidal resurfacing are: initially high-sloped regions (>30◦ 
) regardless of the encounter orientation of Apophis, and mid-sloped regions (15◦ –30◦ ) that experience a 
significant positive slope variation (>0.5◦ ), which is mainly controlled by the encounter orientation. Expected 
data from ground-based observations of the 2029 flyby will help us better constrain the targeted locations likely 
to experience tidal resurfacing. We thus expect to find evidence supporting tidal resurfacing via further analysis 
of post-encounter surface images or albedo changes at the expected resurfaced areas.
